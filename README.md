# UsedCarPricePredictor
Overview
The Used Car Price Predictor is a machine learning application designed to estimate the market value of used cars based on various features. By leveraging historical data on car sales, the model enables users to predict the price of a used car, assisting both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
pandas for data manipulation and analysis
numpy for numerical operations
scikit-learn for implementing various machine learning algorithms
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization

Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the predictive model is evaluated using:

Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): Measures the average magnitude of the prediction error.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Represents the average absolute prediction error.
RÂ² Score: Indicates the proportion of variance explained by the model.
Data
The model is trained on a dataset comprising various used cars with features such as make, model, year, mileage, and price. The dataset enables the model to learn the relationships between these variables and the price of used cars.

Future Enhancements
Additional Features: Incorporate more attributes like vehicle condition, accident history, and service history for enhanced predictions.
User Authentication: Implement user accounts for personalized experience and saved predictions.
Mobile Application: Develop a mobile version of the price predictor for broader accessibility.
